## Description

I enjoyed this activity very much. This project we were required to create a professional readme-generator. First we had to create a package.json file using npm init -y within the terminal. We also had to install a third party npm package called inquirer, which we used to help create the question and answer methods that users answer to help create the professional readme. We also had to bring in specific formatting for creating an array of objects straight from the inquirer documentation, in order to create the quetsiosn we asked the user. Overall this was a challenging exercise but I enjoyed it greatly.
